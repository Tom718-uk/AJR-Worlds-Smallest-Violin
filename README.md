-- AJR - World's Smallest Violin Trombone Champ Custom Chart


Hey there. Sorry about the quality, I think this is good enough to publish. This is my first attempt at a custom chart, as I have seen this song requested. 

Please be kind, as I am constantly learning how to improve my charting skills. As of now, there is no scheduled revision of this chart, meaning this could be the final draft of this song.

If you wish to download the .rrp file, and edit it yourself, that is fine. All I ask is that you mention me as the original creator. I don't mind if you want to improve my work. See below for installation instructions.


-- INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Before you start make sure you have referenced this file on how to install TrombLoader: https://trombone.wiki/#/installing-mods

1. Download the zip file from the GitHub repository
2. Place the "World's Smallest Violin" folder into your "../TromboneChamp/BepInEx/CustomSongs"
3. Restart your Trombone Champ
4. All done!

You can ignore "ajr.rrp" unless you wish to edit the song I have created. Once again, you may try and clean this song up, but do not take credit for my work. I worked very hard on this song.

I hope you pick my future songs that will come out! Remember if you want any just post in #chart-requests on the Trombone Champ Modding Discord: https://discord.gg/JwVGTrqR


Many thanks,
